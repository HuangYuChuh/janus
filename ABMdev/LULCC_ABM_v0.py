# Outline of algorithm...

# 0. Declare some key variables
#   - Name of spatial domain map with LULCC classes 
#   - Name of spatial domain map with active/inactive cells (e.g., national forests, etc.)
#   - Name of spatial domain map of urban expansion areas
#   - Name of spatial domain map of any ag attributes needed (e.g., type of ag - leased etc.)
#   - Number of simulation years or time steps
#   - Output interval
#   - Output base name

# 1. Preprocessing
#   - Load spatial maps
#   - Set up any agent classes for spatial domains
#   - Create any temporary, derived spatial domains
#   - Create storage containers for LULCC simulations (NaNs outside active domain?)
#   - Create any exogenous agent types needed (e.g., regulators, global markets)

# 2. Simulation loop
#   - Loop through time
#       > Do any needed statistics at the beginning of time (i.e., update neighborhood stats for farmers, urban areas, etc.)
#       > Get any new global info needed (i.e., value of crops, number of potential developers in reservoir)
#       > Get all farmer types
#           - Compute happiness metric based on urbanness, global crop price
#           - Unhappy agents:
#               > If in urban expansion zone, choose between: stay, sell, switch to corporate
#               > If not in urban expansion zone, choose between: stay, sell (exurb), switch to corporate 
#       > Decrement urban types depending on number of farmers that sell
#       > Decrement exurban types developing on number of farmers that sell
#       > Urban fraction inside development zone > threshold?
#           - Yes: expand urban zone to accommodate 20 years' growth (this actually comes from COMPASS)
#           - No: Do nothing
#       > Add new urban types for next year
#       > Add new exurban types for next year

# 3. Save output
#   - Aggregate statistics through time (csv or NetCDF)
#   - Spatial land use patterns through time (NetCDF)
